#Webkit Plugin for Retroshare

This embeds webkit in a plugin page, along with the startings of a javascript bridge
Still some way to go to be handy, but enough is implemented for simple broadcast chat functionality

## Quick Start:

Build and install the plugin as usual.
run from the directory with the (missing) html files... (to be improved)
