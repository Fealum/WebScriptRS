#Webkit Plugin for Retroshare

This embeds webkit in a plugin page, along with the startings of a javascript bridge<br>
Still some way to go to be handy, So far it can broadcast, and perhaps send targeted messages<br>
implemented tests include<br>
-broadcast chat<br>
-three.js circle... shared drawing... thing<br>
-simple physics test with dodgy "averaging" of pos/vel over network.



###### Warning Watch your cpu and network usage when running the latter two tests.<br> Should be fine.

## Usage:

Build and install the plugin as usual.<br>
run RetroShare from the directory with the html files
