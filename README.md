#Webkit Plugin for Retroshare

This embeds webkit in a plugin page, along with the startings of a javascript bridge
Still some way to go to be handy, but enough is implemented for simple broadcast chat functionality

## Usage:

Build and install the plugin as usual.
run RetroShare from the directory with the html file
